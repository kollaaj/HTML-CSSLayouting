# HTML & CSS Layouting

## Description

I re-created an existing poster using HTML and CSS to exercise 
my new found CSS skills on positioning things in "unusual and interesting" ways. 
I included the original 
poster for comparison. I couldn't find the exact same font as the original 
(I tried every single one that Figma had to offer) but I ended up using
 four different ones that were the closest for each section. I made use of:

- Box model
- Flexbox
- Transform property
- Position property

In retrospect I could have used grids for the info div, but it works as is so maybe next time.
